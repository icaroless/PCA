## Settings and processes

To run the application, first open it in your ```Java``` IDE and start the Back-End by clicking on the green symbol (play) at the top of the screen.

Inside the project directory, open the app folder and start the terminal inside the directory (shift + right mouse button on Windows) and select "open terminal window here". Run the ```yarn start``` command. If you do not have the Front End modules, download the ```Node.js``` package and then install ```yarn``` with the command ```npm install --global yarn``` (use the command prompt on Windows, the power shell does not work). As soon as you finish saying that the server is running, open your browser and go to the page ```http: // localhost: 3000 /```. The application should be ready.

It is recommended to use visual studio code software to build the project's front end, as it is lighter and has better tools for this than the Back End IDEs.
